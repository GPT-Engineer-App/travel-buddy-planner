# travel-buddy-planner

the plan:
This plan outlines the development of a travel planning website similar to TripAdvisor, HotelsCombined, Trivago, and Booking.com. It combines functionalities for trip planning, hotel and restaurant booking, attraction discovery, and user reviews/photos.

the website will include those kinds of accounts: 
1- normal users
2- hotels
3- transport agencies: like buses or flight agencies
4- touristic places, like restaurants, museums...etc
5- group travel agencies

first: from the user's perspective: 
1- search for hotels, transport agencies, and touristic places, and even filter the search by city or prices.
2- enable to reserve hotels, transport agencies, touristic places
3- enable him to plan his trips in one place, and schedule his trips
4- enable to leave a review on the hotel, transport agencies, touristic places and also share pictures of the place that he visited


second: the reason that hotels, transport agencies, tourist places have their accounts is to make them able to manage their income, update the pictures of their place or services, and add the services they provide, and they can be able to track the reservations from users
from their perspective, there will be a dashboard that is special for them, then we have 3 kinds of special dashboards.

third: there will be also travel agencies, those agencies' mission is to organize group trips, as we know, that group trips are cheaper, and also, planning for a trip may be overwhelming and take much time, especially for those who are busy, therefore those agency's mission is to plan the whole trip, starting from reserving the best transport method, to reserving hotels and choosing the touristic places to visit.

This was a quick explanation of those agencies, now from their perspective account: they can search for hotels, transport agencies, and tourist places just like any normal user on the website, and make the reservation needed, the only difference is that the agencies are the difference is that when they do reservation, they make a reservation for groups, not individuals.
they first set the number of people in the group, second, they plan the trip and get a discount for all services depending on the number of people in the group (as much it is bigger, as much they have discounts), third, they publish their plans so the normal users can see them, and the normal users apply to it, when the number of people complete, the trip is signed and the money is transferred to the other agencies.

lastly: there will be an admin dashboard that can manage this functionality
